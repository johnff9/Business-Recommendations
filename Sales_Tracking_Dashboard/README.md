Reference this as we finalize our dashboards
Get creative -- mostly with the colors, ie if we use one color for one country, use it across the board, and we'll try to keep the fonts consistent. Mostly just here so we can somewhat keep things in the same tonal range w/o being too jarring


Honestly, first person to add a color for a particular area, or font size/type etc, add your thing, and then others should just copy it, unless there's a conflict color wise, like some too similar or whatever. Create an issue in the board if there is a conflict you can't resolve by changing one of your colors, goal is to minimize the total number of times we have to change things up.

Feel free to add categories if I missed any

Dashboard Requirements
You will create and present tableau file that communicates the following:

What are our sales numbers by the following:
Location
Product Line
Deal Size
Status
What are our monthly sales numbers? What do you expect them to be over the next 12 months?
What is our typical sale size?
Who are our best customers?
Are there other interesting insights you found in the data? (There is not specific requirements here just an open ended option to share things you find)
 

Assignment Submission
What you will turn in:

A completed data project template:
Business Objective: The real-world problem this project will address.
Expected Uses: How does the team plan to use this dashboard? Weekly reviews of sales numbers?
Reporting Requirements: The metrics to include in the dashboard and questions that should be answered by the dashboard.
Data Requirements: An outline of the data that is needed to provide the above value.
Data Dictionary and Definitions: A living document that give details on the data in the report. (Will learn more about later)
Out of scope: What you will not be addressing in this project.
The tableau file you presented in class. 
Each student will need to submit a comment to the instructor answering the following questions:
What part(s) of the assignment did you contribute to?
What were the hardest parts of this assignment?
Were there any challenges with your group this week?
 

Presentation
On 1/28/2025 each group will give a 5-10 minute presentation on their dashboard. This presentation should include:

Your data project template and assumptions you made about the data.
Visualizations that communicated the above bullet points. 
At least one Dashboard and one Story in Tableau.
Each group member should participate in the presentation. 
 

Tips
I am not requiring you to use GitHub for this first assignment but I encourage you to think about how you will manage multiple people working on the same report. My suggestions are:
Use Github
Create a shared Google Drive or OneDrive folder to store all project materials. Have each student upload any changes they make to the dashboard.
Try out Tableau Server. You should be able to get a free account to try it out for a few weeks.
If you are using Github or a shared folder you will likely need to create a packaged Tableau workbook https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/save_savework_packagedworkbooks.htmLinks to an external site. 
Have regular meeting to check in on the project and make sure you are working towards the same goal. 
We humble and approach the all challenges as a team working to fix the problem rather than working against each other.
