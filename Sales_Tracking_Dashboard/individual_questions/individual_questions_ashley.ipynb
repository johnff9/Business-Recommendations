    "#### What part(s) of the assignment did you contribute to? \n",
    "I created the project template, including the data dictionary. I logged our assumptions. I created a sales dashboard highlighting weekly sales based on region and with the ability to view both sales figures by week, as well as plots of weekly sales and running sales tally, filterable by dates and region.  I also created a story board, with graphical depictions of global sales by both country and city, as well as a sortable list of customers by city and sales amounts. I created a plot of sales versus price, separated by product line and showing an interesting insight.  I contributed to the project board and brainstorming for presentation outline and helping to coordinate team actions.\n",
