Color blind friendly pallettes

Reference this as we finalize our dashboards
Get creative -- mostly with the colors, ie if we use one color for one country, use it across the board, and we'll try to keep the fonts consistent. Mostly just here so we can somewhat keep things in the same tonal range w/o being too jarring


Honestly, first person to add a color for a particular area, or font size/type etc, add your thing, and then others should just copy it, unless there's a conflict color wise, like some too similar or whatever. Create an issue in the board if there is a conflict you can't resolve by changing one of your colors, goal is to minimize the total number of times we have to change things up.

Feel free to add categories if I missed any
